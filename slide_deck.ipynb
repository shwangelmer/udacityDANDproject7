    "## Investigation Overview\n",
    "I will show the importance of investigating PISA data using the means that were suggested in the PISA Data Analysis Manual. We will examine the sample sizes of various countries and their effect on the subsequent analysis, when assuming standard methods are faultless. I hope to demonstrate the importance of using PISA's suggested data wrangling methods of weighting, plausible value calculation, and replication. These are essential for compensating for inherent increases in error and data anomalies, such as varying sample sizes depending on country.\n",

    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a means of measuring 15-year-old student ability in reading, mathematics, and science. The assessments are conducted every 3 years since 2000, and usually garner participation from about 80 countries. The following presentation investigates a small, key subset of the full dataset for the 34 member countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)."

    "## PISA Student Sampling is Not Uniform\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommended minimum sample size for PISA testing is 5000 students. Most countries come close to it or slightly exceed it, but there are notable exceptions. Iceland is an outlier in that they are population-limited and do not have enough 15-year-olds to reach that number. To compensate for this and the countries that choose to test far beyond the minimum, PISA provides weights for student responses based on the country's total population. This is one of several methods to ensure the accuracy of analysis."

    "## Overtesting Skews Summary Statistics\n",
    "At 38.2% of the total global sample, just four countries (Mexico, Italy, Spain, and Canada) account for more than a third of the student responses. Since PISA does not put an upper limit on how many students can be tested, the weighting of the responses is vital to any data analysis that seeks to draw conclusions about the global population. Without weighting, the larger number of responses from those countries with more testing would disproportionately affect any summary statistics calculated for the global population."
