I don't think a transformation would be helpful for that reason. Adding a line to indicate the 5,000 suggested minimum sample size may help. For `Sex`, there were slightly more female (50.18%) than male (49.82%) students. The remaining metrics of `SocioEconIndex`, `MathScore`, `ReadScore`, and `ScienceScore` are constructed scores that are designed to have normal distributions, so there was nothing unusual about them and did not require any transformations.\n",

I did perform operations on the dataset as a whole to eliminate countries with partial testing, and non-OECD countries as they tend to have more erratic results. The `SocioEconIndex` distribution had a minimum of -5.62, but I opted to start the histogram at -4 to show more detail because the y-axis scale would not even show the points below -4."
